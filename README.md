# Unity Input Manager Helper 
## A file editor for Unity Input Manager Assets

I’ve always found editing the input axes for games in Unity to be about as pleasant as having teeth pulled, just minus the charming company of the dentist and her equally charming assistant.

So over the years I’ve slowly put together an editing app of my own. It started in (roughly) 2015 I think, and has had the odd bit added here and there, plus (of course) the mistakes and other bugs fixed.

I know that these days we’re supposed to use the new Unity input system, but, good though it is, a lot of the time it’s just too involved for the kind of games I tend to produce. So although by now I always thought that I would have ditched the old input system for the new one, it just hasn’t happened that way: I keep coming back to the old ways.

There are still things here and there that I always wanted to add but never got around to: a window displaying the “history” of deleted axes, a folder in `Documents` in which any Asset documents are automatically opened on launch, drag and drop between different settings files (at the moment it’s copy and paste only).

But even as it is, I still find it to be a very useful app, so perhaps others will feel the same way.
